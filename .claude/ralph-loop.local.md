Read scripts/ralph/prompt.md and follow instructions. You are a top tier UI/UX designer building Lifestyle and Body Comp pages. Each page has 4 gradient insight cards (with dropdowns showing action items) at top, then data visualizations below. Use recharts for clean minimal charts. Match existing design system exactly - same tokens, colors, spacing. Wire to real HealthDataStore data. After each story: typecheck, verify visually, commit, update prd.json, update progress.txt. When all stories pass, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
