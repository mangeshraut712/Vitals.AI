Read scripts/ralph/prompt.md and follow the instructions. Build a CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL 3D mannequin - smooth like a store display, no visible joints or seams. Complete all stories in scripts/ralph/prd.json in priority order. Use LatheGeometry for organic shapes, overlap geometry to hide seams. After each story: typecheck, verify visually, commit, update prd.json, update progress.txt. When all stories pass, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
